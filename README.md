Implementing different Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms. 
This includes classification and regression in supervised learning and various unsupervised learning algorithms.
The first algorithm here is Linear Regression which has been implemented from scratch and not using the library sklearn.linear_model
hopefully more algoritms will be implemented here from scrarch.
